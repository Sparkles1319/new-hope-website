                                                    <h2>Computed Tomography (CT) Services</h2>
                                                    <p>Our CT equipment is a multi-slice state-of-the-art equipment produced by Siemens. It allows for acquisition of the highest image quality at the shortest possible time. This also allows for the reduction of radiation dosage to the patient which would normally be of great concern to the patient.  Our team of workers is highly trained and skilled at giving the best quality of service to patients. </p>
                                                    <blockquote>
                                                        CT examinations that we carry out include Head CT, Neck CT, Thoracic CT, Abdominal CT, Pelvic CT, CT of the spine, CT of the limbs, etc
                                                    </blockquote>
                                                    <p>We also carry out Contrast CT Examinations and CT Angiography using an auto-injector which provides the most accurate diagnostic state of the blood vessels.
                                                        CT examinations could be carried out to detect internal injuries, bleeds, tumours, bone fractures and dislocations and to determine their precise location in the body.
