                    <h2>X-Ray, Scans and Imagery Services</h2>
                    <p>Our X-ray equipment is a direct conversion digital type, produced by GE. It produces the best image quality at the shortest possible time. Our radiographers are highly skilled in carrying out a long range of X-ray examinations including special examinations like HSG (X-ray of the female reproductive system), IVU (X-ray of the urinary system), Barium Examinations (X-ray of the Digestive System/ Alimentary Canal, RUCG, MCUG (X-ray of the bladder and the urethra), Fistulography (X-ray examination of fistulas), not excluding the routine and emergency X-ray examinations. </p>
                    <blockquote>
                        We also have a dedicated equipment for Mammography (X-ray of the mammary glands/ breast).

                    <p>Ultrasound is a test that uses sound waves to produce images of organse inside your body. No x-rays or radiation is used in this test.

                        Ultrasound can give your doctor information that may help in your diagnosis and treatment. Most soft tissue organs can be studied with ultrasound. For instance, the gall bladder may be checked for gallstones. The kidney, liver and pancreas can be studied for tumors or cysts.</p>
                    <p>

                        Blood vessels can be checked for swelling or blockage. Ultrasound is also used to evaluate pregnancy. The growth, position and number of babies in the mother's uterus can be see via the ultrasound scan.</p>

                        <p>Our ultrasound machines can do all body scans and render 4D pictures if needed.</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        Our imaging results are available within minutes to aid speedy diagnosis and treatment of patients.
