                        FBC is a very common procedure and often the starting point for mose medical investigations. FBC not only tests for disorders and abnormalities of the blood, but as blood travels throughout the whole body, it can give an indication of disease present in other organs.

                        Test parameters are: White blood cell count, Red blood cell count, Platelets count, Haemoglobin level, and differentials such as Neutrophils, Lymphocytes, Monocytes, Eosinophils, Basophils and others. </p>
                    <blockquote>
