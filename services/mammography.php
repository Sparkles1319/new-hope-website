                    <h2>Mammography</h2>
                    <p>Mammography is the process of using low-energy x-rays to examine the human breast for tumors. The objective of this screening is to detect breast cancer as early as possible, thus, getting an accurate result is very important.</p>
                    <blockquote>Our mammography x-ray machine can find tumours as tiny as a grain of rice and the results are very reliable.</blockquote>
                    <p>Images from a mammogram can help find calcifications or calcium deposits in the breasts. The test can also find cysts (which are fluid-filled sacs that may come and go normally during some women's menstrual cycles) and any cancerous or non-cancerous lumps.</p>
