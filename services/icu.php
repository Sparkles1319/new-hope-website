                        Our ICU is capable of invasive cardiovascular monitoring including arterial and central venous lines plus central venous pressure (CVP) monitoring.

                    <p>
                        The beds are of good ICU standards (in accord with American Heart Association guidelines) that use remotes and can be adjusted to suit patientsâ€™ comfort at all times.
                        The unit also has a HAEMODIALYSIS MACHINE for patients who are diagnosed with acute kidney failure (injury). There is also mobile digital X-ray equipment, a portable colour Doppler ultrasound equipment and nearby CT scan equipment allowing earlier and quicker patient diagnosis in order to properly manage our patients. A 24-hour power supply is available to ensure uninterrupted running of the ICU.

                       Our ICU also has an ISTAT machine, coagulation instrument and others for urgent comprehensive laboratory investigations. Other sophisticated devices include infusion pumps for fluid delivery, syringe pumps for medications, etc. To reduce/ eliminate nosocomial infections, our ICU undergoes monthly fumigations, carried out by experts, to maintain a germ free environment.
